# Hangman-Evolved

This is a newer version of Hangman. Instead of just words, we are using whole phrases (and sometimes sentences). Here, I am mainly using some quotes from Sherlock and Doctor Who (because I am addicted to these two series). You can play as many times as you wish. Just answer "yes" when the bot asks you.

_To be fixed:<br>
1.Add more phrases to the game<br>
2.Add score counting<br>
(At some point I will make a pygame version so that it has buttons and pictures and stuff)_
